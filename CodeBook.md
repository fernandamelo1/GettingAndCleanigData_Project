We have 68 variables.

Decoding the abbreviated variables names can be accomplished using this key prepared by a careful study of the features_info.txt file of the original data set:

* t = time 
* f = frequency 
* Body = body 
* Gravity = gravity 
* Acc = accelerometer 
* Gyro = gyroscope 
* Jerk = jerk, derived from body measurements 
* X = x-axis 
* Y = y-axis 
* Z = z-axis 
* Mag = magnitude 
* Mean = mean value 
* Std = standard deviation 


Further explanations of the variable naming scheme can be found in the features_info.txt file of the original data set.



 
"Features" - values and units
=============================

From the README.txt provided with the original raw data set:


* Body acceleration = total acceleration - gravity 
* Acceleration: standard gravity units 'g' 
* Gyroscope: radians/second 
* All features: normalized and bounded within [-1,1]
