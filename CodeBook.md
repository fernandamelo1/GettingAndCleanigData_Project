The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).

We have 68 variables.

Decoding the abbreviated variables names can be accomplished using this key prepared by a careful study of the features_info.txt file of the original data set:

* t = time 
* f = frequency 
* Body = body 
* Gravity = gravity 
* Acc = accelerometer 
* Gyro = gyroscope 
* Jerk = jerk, derived from body measurements 
* X = x-axis 
* Y = y-axis 
* Z = z-axis 
* Mag = magnitude 
* Mean = mean value 
* Std = standard deviation 


Further explanations of the variable naming scheme can be found in the features_info.txt file of the original data set.



 
"Features" - values and units
-----------------------------

From the README.txt provided with the original raw data set:


* Body acceleration = total acceleration - gravity 
* Acceleration: standard gravity units 'g' 
* Gyroscope: radians/second 
* All features: normalized and bounded within [-1,1]
