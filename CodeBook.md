We have 68 variables.

Decoding the abbreviated variables names can be accomplished using this key prepared by a careful study of the features_info.txt file of the original data set:
•t = time
•f = frequency
•Body = body
•Gravity = gravity
•Acc = accelerometer
•Gyro = gyroscope
•Jerk = jerk, derived from body measurements
•X = x-axis
•Y = y-axis
•Z = z-axis
•Mag = magnitude
•Mean = mean value
•Std = standard deviation


Further explanations of the variable naming scheme can be found in the features_info.txt file of the original data set.





 
"Features" - values and units


From the README.txt provided with the original raw data set:
•Body acceleration = total acceleration - gravity
•Acceleration: standard gravity units 'g'
•Gyroscope: radians/second
•All features: normalized and bounded within [-1,1]
